# Installation instructions

## Quick installation

    CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -ldflags='-s -w'
    mkdir groups
    echo '{"presenter": [{}]}' > groups/test.json
    ./galene &

Then connect to `https://localhost:8443` and choose "test".

## Full installation instructions

### Build the `galene` binary

You will need Go 1.17 or later (type `go version`).  Then do:

    CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -ldflags='-s -w'

On Windows, do

    set CGO_ENABLED=0
    go build -ldflags="-s -w"


### Set up a group

Set up a group called *test* by creating a file `groups/test.json`:

    mkdir groups
    vi groups/name.json
    
You may use the following definition:

    {
        "op": [{"username": "admin", "password": "1234"}],
        "presenter": [{}]
    }

See the README file for more details about defining groups.


### Test locally

    ./galene &
    
You should be able to access Galène at `https://localhost:8443`.  Connect
to the group that you have just set up in two distinct browser windows,
then press *Ready* in one of the two; you should see a video in the other.


### Configure your server's firewall

If your server has a global IPv4 address and there is no firewall, there
is nothing to do.

If your server has a global IPv4 address, then the firewall must, at
a strict minimum, allow incoming traffic to TCP port 8443 (or whatever is
configured with the `-http` command-line option) and TCP port 1194 (or
whatever is configured with the `-turn` option).  For best performance, it
should also allow UDP traffic to the TURN port, and UDP traffic to
ephemeral (high-numbered) ports (or whatever is configured using the
`-udp-range` option).

If your server is behind NAT (which is not recommended), then the NAT must
forward, at the very least, port 8443 to your server.  Ideally, you should
configure an external TURN server (see *ICE Servers* below) on a host that
is not behind NAT.  If that is not possible, then you must use a NAT that
supports hairpinning, you must forward port 1194 in addition to port 8443,
and you will need to add add the option `-turn 203.0.113.1:1194` to
Galène's command line, where `203.0.113.1` is your NAT's external (global)
IPv4 address.


### Cross-compile for your server

This step is only required if your server runs a different OS or has
a different CPU than your build machine.

For a Linux server with an Intel or AMD CPU:

    CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -ldflags='-s -w'

For a Raspberry Pi 1:

    CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm GOARM=6 go build -ldflags='-s -w'

For a BeagleBone or a Raspberry Pi 2 or later:

    CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm GOARM=7 go build -ldflags='-s -w'

For a 64-bit ARM board (Olimex Olinuxino-A64, Pine64, etc.) or server:

    CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm64 go build -ldflags='-s -w'

For a 32-bit MIPS board with no hardware floating point (WNDR3800, etc.):

    CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux GOARCH=mips GOMIPS=softfloat go build -ldflags='-s -w'


### Deploy to your server

Set up a user *galene* on your server, then do:

    rsync -a galene static data groups galene@server.example.org:

If you don't have a TLS certificate, Galène will generate a self-signed
certificate automatically (and print a warning to the logs).  If you have
a certificate, install it in the files `data/cert.pem` and `data/key.pem`:

    ssh galene@server.example.org
    sudo cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/server.example.org/fullchain.pem data/cert.pem
    sudo cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/server.example.org/privkey.pem data/key.pem
    sudo chown galene:galene data/*.pem
    sudo chmod go-rw data/key.pem
    
Now arrange to run the binary on the server.  If you never reboot your
server, it might be as simple as

    ssh galene@server.example.org
    ulimit -n 65536
    nohup ./galene &

If you are using *runit*, use a script like the following:

    #!/bin/sh
    exec 2>&1
    cd ~galene
    ulimit -n 65536
    exec setuidgid galene ./galene

If you are using *systemd*:

    [Unit]
    Description=Galene
    After=network.target

    [Service]
    Type=simple
    WorkingDirectory=/home/galene
    User=galene
    Group=galene
    ExecStart=/home/galene/galene
    LimitNOFILE=65536

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target


# Running behind a reverse proxy

Galene is designed to be directly exposed to the Internet.  In order to
run Galene behind a reverse proxy, you might need to make a number of
tweaks to your configuration.

First, you might need to inform Galene of the URL at which users connect
(the reverse proxy's URL) by adding an entry `proxyURL` to your
`data/config.json` file:

    {
        "proxyURL": "https://galene.example.org/"
    }

Second, and depending on your proxy implementation, you might need to
request that the proxy pass WebSocket handshakes to the URL at `ws`; for
example, with Nginx, you will need to say something like the following:

    location /ws {
        proxy_pass ...;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
    }

Finally, in order to avoid TLS termination issues, you may want to run
Galene over plain HTTP instead of HTTPS by using the command-line flag
`-insecure`.

Note that even if you're using a reverse proxy, clients will attempt to
establish direct UDP flows with Galene and direct TCP connections to
Galene's TURN server; see the section on "Configuring your firewall"
above.


# Connectivity issues and ICE Servers

Most connectivity issues are due to an incorrect ICE configuration.

ICE is the NAT and firewall traversal protocol used by WebRTC.  ICE can
make use of two kinds of servers to help with NAT traversal: STUN servers,
that help punching holes in well-behaved NATs, and TURN servers, that
serve as relays for traffic.  TURN is a superset of STUN: no STUN server
is necessary if one or more TURN servers are available.

Galène includes an IPv4-only TURN server, which is controlled by the
`-turn` command-line option.  It has the following behaviour:

  * if its value is set to the empty string `""`, then the built-in server
    is disabled; in this case, the file `data/ice-servers.json` configures
    an external TURN server;

  * if its value is a colon followed with a port number, for example
    `:1194`, then the TURN server will listen on all public IPv4 addresses
    of the local host, over UDP and TCP; this is the recommended value if
    the server is not behind NAT, and the firewall allows incoming
    connections to port 1194;

  * if the value of this option is a socket address, such as
    `203.0.113.1:1194`, then the TURN server will listen on all addresses
    of the local host but assume that the address seen by the clients is
    the one given in the option; this is useful when running behind NAT
    with port forwarding set up.

  * the default value is `auto`, which behaves like `:1194` if there is no
    `data/ice-servers.json` file, and like `""` otherwise.

If the server is not accessible from the Internet, e.g. because of NAT or
because it is behind a restrictive firewall, then you should configure
a TURN server that runs on a host that is accessible by both Galène and
the clients.  Disable the built-in TURN server (`-turn ""` or the default
`-turn auto`), and provide a working ICE configuration in the file
`data/ice-servers.json`.  In the case of a single STUN server, it should
look like this:

    [
        {
            "urls": [
                "stun:stun.example.org"
            ]
        }
    ]
    
In the case of s single TURN server, the `ice-servers.json` file should
look like this:

    [
        {
            "urls": [
                "turn:turn.example.org:443",
                "turn:turn.example.org:443?transport=tcp"
            ],
            "username": "galene",
            "credential": "secret"
        }
    ]

It is more secure to use coturn's `use-auth-secret` option.  If you do
that, then the `ice-servers.json` file should look like this:

    [
        {
            "urls": [
                "turn:turn.example.com:443",
                "turn:turn.example.com:443?transport=tcp"
            ],
            "username": "galene",
            "credential": "secret",
            "credentialType": "hmac-sha1"
        }
    ]
    
For redundancy, you may set up multiple TURN servers, and ICE will use the
first one that works.  If an `ice-servers.json` file is present and
Galène's built-in TURN server is enabled, then the external server will be
used in preference to the built-in server.
