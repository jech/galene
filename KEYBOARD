# Use of the keyboard with Galene

People wich are not able to use a mouse need to have other possibilities.

Some user will use the keyboard in order to navigate to the galene Web
Interface and will use the Tab Key to select the wanted element and
other key as arrow up, down, space.

User with visual impairement, may use a screenreader.

For keyboard user we can use the following keys:

- 'u' goto user list 
- 'c' go to  the chat input box
- 'r' raise, unraise hand
- 'm' mute, unmute


- Esc close contextual menu, close the setting, close the chat box,
close the user list


For the screenreader user, it is difficult to provide shortcuts, most
keys or keys combination are reserved from the OS the screenreader and
the browser.

In order to offer a faster way for selecting the wanted element, we use
thw header navigation (h1, h2. h3).

- The key 1 will got to the main Title of the page.
- The key 2 will allow to select one of the area user list, chat box or media area.
- The key 3 allow to navigate from message to message.
- The Tab and Esc key work as for the normal keyboard user

Screenreader shall announce the error and warning textes issued by galene,
this is also implemented.
