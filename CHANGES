Galene 0.96 (unreleased):

  * Implemented asynchronous filters.
  * Implemented background blur.
  * More fixes to RTCP feedback signalling (thanks to Sean DuBois).

4 December 2024: Galene 0.95

  * Galene now requires Go 1.20.
  * Added "galenectl" utility and removed "galene-password-generator".
    This is an incompatible change.
  * Fixed a number of bugs in the management protocol.
  * Implemented captions for the galene-stt tool.
  * Reworked the peer-to-peer file transfer protocol.  This is an
    incompatible change.
  * Added an id to every chat message, and made it possible to remove
    a single chat message.
  * Fixed a race condition that prevented operators from joining an
    AutoKick group.
  * Fixed a bug that could cause us to signal our ability to do RTCP
    feedback incorrectly.
  * Fixed a bug that would trigger JavaScript errors when a user attempted
    to send a file to themself.

15 July 2024: Galene 0.9.1

  * Added an example client with minimal functionality under static/example.
  * Changed the token login to force a user interaction in order to avoid
    issues with autoplay.
  * Fixed a race condition that would cause the client to run with
    undefined settings if the initial connection was extremely fast.
  * Implemented client-side timeouts (we already had one on the server side).
  * Reduced the server-side timeout.
  * Don't attempt to set the file descriptor limit, since recent versions
    of the Go runtime do it automatically.

26 May 2024: Galene 0.9

  * Reworked the group definition format to be more modular.  There are
    some incompatible changes: multiple users with the same username but
    distinct passords are no longer supported, and the field
    "allow-anonymous" is ignored.
  * Reworked the definition of administrator passwords in config.json.
    The old field "admin" is ignored, a new field "users" is required.
    This is an incompatible change.
  * Implemented an administrative API over HTTP.  Set the field
    "writableGroups" in config.json to enable it.  The API is described in
    the file "README.API", a JavaScript library is in management.js.
  * Implemented a form to allow users to change their password.  If the
    HTTP API is enabled, a link will appear in the side menu.
  * Implemented a new command "/identify" (also availble in the users
    menu) that discloses the IP address from which a user connected.
  * Implemented a contextual menu that triggers on a double click on
    a chat entry.
  * Added a new command "/stopshare".
  * Added a new permission "message" and new commands "shutup" and "unshutup".
  * Changed stateless token validation to attempt all keys rather than
    just the first matching one.

26 May 2024: Galene 0.8.3

  * Fixed a bug that could allow any user to clear the chat.

14 April 2024: Galene 0.8.2

  * Fixed possible crashes in the VP8 and AV1 parsers.
  * Fixed keyframe detection for VP8 and VP9.

9 March 2024: Galene 0.8.1

  * Security fixes to WHIP ingress.
  * Improved error messages for authentication failures.
  * Added "expires" and "not-before" to group descriptions.
  * Allow proxyURL to contain a path, for people who run Galene at
    non-root URLs.  This requires manually modifying the files under
    'static/' in order to point at the right locations.

25 November 2023: Galene 0.8

  * Added a new configuration option "publicServer".
  * Implemented the WHIP protocol (draft-ietf-wish-whip).
  * Disabled simulcast on Firefox by default.
  * Removed support for protocol version 1 (used before version 0.7)
  * Worked around clients that don't set the VP9 and H.264 profiles.
  * Updated the activity detection code to work with newer browsers.
    Thanks to Jackson Vieira.
  * Constrained videos sent from a browser to use 4:3 aspect.
  * Implemented BCrypt as an alternate password encryption algorithm.

9 July 2023: Galene 0.7.2

  * Improved workaround for Safari's autoplay-related mis-features.
  * Fixed minor bugs related to stateful tokens.

14 May 2023: Galene 0.7.1

  * Fixed incorrect error-handling in token parsing, which could cause
    Galene to crash after receiving a mis-formatted token.
  * Implement a dialog for creating tokens.
  * Tweaked peer-to-peer file transfer to more reliably return an error
    message to the user.
  * Fixed the workaround for non-standard simulcast in older Firefox
    versions.

10 April 2023: Galene 0.7.0

  * Updated the protocol version to 2.  Dates are now represented in
    ISO 8601 format, and there is a new "error" field in error messages
    that contains a machine-readable identifier.
  * Implemented stateful tokens ("invitations").
  * Made more errors non-fatal, which makes it possible for the client
    to recover in more situations.
  * Reworked the progress indicator used during file transfer.
  * Added Referrer-Policy and X-Content-Type-Options headers to HTTP
    responses (Galene was already generating HTML links with the
    "noreferrer" option).  Thanks to Alexandre Iooss.
  * Fixed a bug in the handling of leave messages.  (The bundled client
    never sends leave, it just disconnects, so the bug never triggerred.)
  * Changed the way simulcast tracks are selected to not depend on the rid.

11 January 2023: Galene 0.6.2

  * Disable simulcast for screensharing; this didn't work well with many
    browsers.
  * Fix parsing of VP8 packets with degenerate headers.
  * Fix computation of group URL when running in insecure mode.
  * Add configuration option "proxyURL", which makes it easier to run
    Galene behind a reverse proxy.
  * Disable ulimit checking on BSD systems, where our code doesn't compile.

7 October 2022: Galene 0.6.1

  * Add a camera/microphone indicator in the users list, and hide
    audio-only peers by default.  They can be reenabled in the side menu.
  * Ensure that autolocked groups are locked on creation.  Thanks to
    Michael Ströder.
  * Don't send chat history multiple times.  Thanks to Rémy Nollet.
  * Fix status display for remote (redirected) groups.

10 September 2022: Galene 0.6

  * Version the protocol: the handshake message now contains a version
    number, and the server will warn if it is incorrect.  This will become
    a hard error in the future.
  * Rework the peer-to-peer file transfer protocol.  It now lives in
    protocol.js, which makes it easy to use by third-party clients.
  * Extend the authorization protocol to allow the authorization server to
    request that the client fall back to password authorization.
  * Make it possible to run the web server on a Unix domain socket.
    Thanks to Martin Pépin.
  * Check that a given group exists before redirecting from the landing
    page.  This avoids an unsightly 404 error when the user makes a typo.
  * Publish the group name end websocket endpoint in the group status.
    This avoids hardwirint the server structure in the client.
  * Fix a race condition that could cause chathistory messages to be sent
    before the joined status.

23 July 2022: Galene 0.5.5

  * Fix a longstanding bug with time conversion that would occasionally
    cause us to miscalculate rates and send incorrect sender reports.
    Thanks to lamhai1401.
  * Update srtp to a version that includes Adrian Cable's optimisations.
    This should yield a 10% to 20% improvement for AES-CTR (but modern
    browsers use GCM).
  * Reword the Safari warning to be more frightening, since screensharing
    on Safari tends to get stuck.

5 May 2022: Galene 0.5.4

  * Fix username check when a token is present.
  * Improve the performance of AES in CTR mode.
  * Tweak detection of keyframes with H.264.

25 April 2022: Galene 0.5.3

  * Remove a forgotten "replace" that prevented 0.5.2 from compiling
    unless "pion/ice" was downloaded manually.
  * Fix a race condition in the rate estimator.
  * Update pion/ice to a version that handles aggressive nomination; this
    avoids broken connection in some (fairly rare) cases.

20 April 2022: Galene 0.5.2

  * Implement audio-video sync in the diskwriter.
  * Fix setting of the keyframe flag in audio samples in diskwriter.
  * Don't use high-quality audio for screenshare by default, obey the
    hqaudio preference in all cases.
  * Maintain user information for oneself, not just other users.
  * Call the onuser callback when a user deletes a stream.

25 March 2022: Galene 0.5.1

  * Enable simulcast on Firefox.
  * Fix rate control on Firefox.
  * Fix corruption after packet reordering when saving to disk.
  * Fix the H.264 profile for compatibility with older iPhones.
  * Display a warning when joining a locked group.
  * Add a hook that allows the client to influence the ICE policy.
  * Fix error handling in peer-to-peer file transfer.

8 March 2022: Galene 0.5

  * Implement third-party (token-based) authentication.
  * Implement peer-to-peer file transfer (/sendfile).
  * Add a contextual menu to the users list.
  * Removed the "Broadcast file" entry in the side menu, it is now
    available as a context menu entry and a chat command (/presentfile).
  * Add side-menu options for high-quality audio (Opus at 128kbps) and
    disabling audio preprocessing.
  * Send audio in addition to video when sharing browser tabs.

1 February 2022: Galene 0.4.4

  * Update dependencies.  Pion WebRTC v3.1.19 fixes a bug that could cause
    audio tracks to be discarded under some circumstances.
  * Fix a bug that could cause user statuses (raisehand) to be discarded.
  * Fix incorrect maxRate value in statistics display.

27 January 2022: Galène 0.4.3

  * Fix a locking issue that could cause a deadlock when massive numbers
    of clients join at the same time.
  * Add support for displaying raised hands (thanks to Sascha Silbe).
  * Update the MIME type for AV1 to track recent browsers.
  * Avoid overflow during rate estimation.
  * More fixes to the disk writer.

1 December 2021: Galène 0.4.2

  * Update the samplebuilder to avoid a crash when a single frame is so
    large that it overflows the buffer.
  * Various other changes that improve the quality of disk recordings.

4 November 2021: Galène 0.4.1

  * Create a new file data/config.json with global configuration.
  * Remove data/passwd and the -redirect option with entries in config.json;
    these are incompatible changes.
  * Change the group URL from /group/name to /group/name/, which allows
    using relative links.  The old URL is redirected to the new one.
  * Extend the protocol with the ability to consult the group status before
    joining; this allows using the group's displayName before the user has
    logged in, and will be required for new authorisation schemes.
  * Allow scrolling of the login dialog, useful on small devices.
  * Fixed a typo that prevented the group name from being displayed.
  * Made failed videos more visible.
  * No longer attempt to save passwords in browser JavaScript, it's
    insecure and not very useful.

5 September 2021: Galène 0.4

  * Implemented simulcast.
  * Implemented scalable video coding (SVC) for VP8 and VP9.
  * Preliminary support for the AV1 codec.
  * Fixed the profile announced for VP9.
  * Reworked the disk writer, which should no longer cause corruption
    after packet loss.
  * Added support for recording H.264 tracks.
  * Reworked the signalling protocol, it is now possible to request
    different tracks for distinct streams, and there are provisions to
    carry user permissions and statuses; this is not yet used by the user
    interface.
  * Reworked internal signalling; this will hopefully fix issues with
    losing tracks under load.
  * Added an option to limit the range of UDP ports used by the server.
  * Added a close button in every locally-generated video; this allows
    closing individual screen shares and simplifies the UI by not creating
    close buttons in the top bar.
  * The server will now attempt to increase the file descriptor limit at
    startup.
  * Stats are now exported as JSON and formatted on the client side; the
    stats URL is now /stats.html rather than just /stats.

27 April 2021: Galène 0.3.4

  * Fixed a bug in the loss estimator.  We will now reduce the rate more
    aggressively when there is loss in the client->serer direction.
  * Fixed display of the chat on some devices.
  * Exported the group.Description data structure for the sake of external
    configuration tools.

16 April 2021: Galène 0.3.3

  * Fixed an off-by-one error that could occasionally lead to a server
    crash.  Thanks to Louis Gesbert.
  * Attempt to negotiate stereo Opus audio.

3 March 2021: Galène 0.3.2

  * Fixed compatibility with versions of Go earlier than 1.15 (thanks to
    Michael Ströder).
  * Fixed a race condition in the disk writer.

26 February 2021: Galène 0.3.1

  * We now notice when the TLS certificate has changed on disk; the
    certificate can therefore be rotated without a restart.
  * We now generate a self-signed certificate if none is found on disk.

18 February 2021: Galène 0.3

  * Implemented the command /muteall.  This allows muting all users except
    yourself.
  * Implemented the autolock and autokick user group options, that cause,
    a group to be locked or all users to be kicked out when the last
    administrator leaves.
  * Implemented client-side filters that are run over the video before it
    is sent to the server.  A pair of mirroring filters are provided,
    which are useful when using a mirror in front of a webcam.
  * Included a built-in TURN server, which drastically simplifies
    deployment in common cases.
  * Implemented testing of TURN servers, on both the client and the server
    side.  Connectivity will be checked by the server every 12 hours, and
    by the client whenever a user uses the /relay-test command.
  * Group configurations are now checked at startup, and any failures are
    logged.  This implies that it is no longer possible to use undefined
    keys in group definition files (this is a breaking change).
  * Reworked the client API, which is now simpler and more uniform.
  * Subgroups can now be public.
  * Added an option to disable the mirror view, which is useful when writing.
  * Ported file playback to Firefox.
  * We now display a friendly error message when the user has disabled
    WebRTC under Firefox.
  * Implemented renegotiation of down streams, which reduces the amount of
    flicker in the user interface.
  * Fixed a number of race conditions that could cause audio tracks to
    become muted or video tracks to freeze.

9 January 2021: Galène 0.2

  * We now work around a limitation of the Go runtime that used to cause
    a crash on 32-bit architectures.
  * Recording to disk now works on Windows too.
  * Error handling has been improved.  In particular, group operators now
    receive a friendly warning when recording to disk fails for some reason.
  * It is now possible to configure a group to use codecs such as VP9 and
    H.264.  The default is still to use VP8 and Opus, as this yields the
    best compatibility across browsers.  Only VP8, VP9 and Opus can be
    saved to disk.
  * The command-line option "-relay-only" can be used to specify that all
    media traffic should go through a TURN server.
  * It is now possible to generate TURN passwords automatically, which
    avoids leaking long-term TURN credentials.  See the "credentialType"
    value "hmac-sha1" described in README.
  * The ICE configuration will now be checked periodically, and new
    clients will use an updated configuration.
  * The client-server protocol has been reworked to be more symmetric
    and more secure.  It is now documented in the file README.PROTOCOL.
  * The stream abort protocol message is now supported in the client->server
    direction, making it possible for the client to reject a stream.
  * The delay before sending NACKs has been reduced, which gives a major
    boost in video quality.
  * The play from disk button is not available when the browser doesn't
    support the required API.  We used to display a cryptic error message
    in that case.
  * The command-line option -insecure allows using plain HTTP, which is
    useful when running behind a reverse proxy.
  * When saving to disk to disk, the keyframe interval has been reduced to 4s.
  * We now send keepalives after 55s at most, which should fix issues with
    reverse proxies timing out the WebSocket.

19 December 2020: Galène 0.1

  * Initial release.
