Galène 0.4 (unreleased):

  * Implemented simulcast.
  * Implemented scalable video coding (SVC) for VP8 and VP9.
  * Preliminary support for the AV1 codec.
  * Fixed the profile announced for VP9.
  * Reworked the disk writer, which should no longer cause corruption
    after packet loss.
  * Added support for recording H.264 tracks.
  * Added a close button to video windows, it is now possible to close
    just a single shared window.
  * Reworked the signalling protocol, it is now possible to request
    different tracks for distinct streams, and there are provisions to
    carry user permissions and statuses; this is not yet used by the user
    interface.
  * The server will now attempt to increase the file descriptor limit at
    startup.
  * Reworked internal signalling; this will hopefully fix issues with
    losing tracks under load.
  * Added an option to limit the range of UDP ports used by the server.
  * Added a close button in every locally-generated video; this allows
    closing individual screen shares and avoids the need for creating
    buttons at the top.
  * Stats are now exported as JSON and formatted on the client side; the
    stats URL is now /stats.html rather than just /stats.

27 April 2021: Galène 0.3.4

  * Fixed a bug in the loss estimator.  We will now reduce the rate more
    aggressively when there is loss in the client->serer direction.
  * Fixed display of the chat on some devices.
  * Exported the group.Description data structure for the sake of external
    configuration tools.

16 April 2021: Galène 0.3.3

  * Fixed an off-by-one error that could occasionally lead to a server
    crash.  Thanks to Louis Gesbert.
  * Attempt to negotiate stereo Opus audio.

3 March 2021: Galène 0.3.2

  * Fixed compatibility with versions of Go earlier than 1.15 (thanks to
    Michael Ströder).
  * Fixed a race condition in the disk writer.

26 February 2021: Galène 0.3.1

  * We now notice when the TLS certificate has changed on disk; the
    certificate can therefore be rotated without a restart.
  * We now generate a self-signed certificate if none is found on disk.

18 February 2021: Galène 0.3

  * Implemented the command /muteall.  This allows muting all users except
    yourself.
  * Implemented the autolock and autokick user group options, that cause,
    a group to be locked or all users to be kicked out when the last
    administrator leaves.
  * Implemented client-side filters that are run over the video before it
    is sent to the server.  A pair of mirroring filters are provided,
    which are useful when using a mirror in front of a webcam.
  * Included a built-in TURN server, which drastically simplifies
    deployment in common cases.
  * Implemented testing of TURN servers, on both the client and the server
    side.  Connectivity will be checked by the server every 12 hours, and
    by the client whenever a user uses the /relay-test command.
  * Group configurations are now checked at startup, and any failures are
    logged.  This implies that it is no longer possible to use undefined
    keys in group definition files (this is a breaking change).
  * Reworked the client API, which is now simpler and more uniform.
  * Subgroups can now be public.
  * Added an option to disable the mirror view, which is useful when writing.
  * Ported file playback to Firefox.
  * We now display a friendly error message when the user has disabled
    WebRTC under Firefox.
  * Implemented renegotiation of down streams, which reduces the amount of
    flicker in the user interface.
  * Fixed a number of race conditions that could cause audio tracks to
    become muted or video tracks to freeze.

9 January 2021: Galène 0.2

  * We now work around a limitation of the Go runtime that used to cause
    a crash on 32-bit architectures.
  * Recording to disk now works on Windows too.
  * Error handling has been improved.  In particular, group operators now
    receive a friendly warning when recording to disk fails for some reason.
  * It is now possible to configure a group to use codecs such as VP9 and
    H.264.  The default is still to use VP8 and Opus, as this yields the
    best compatibility across browsers.  Only VP8, VP9 and Opus can be
    saved to disk.
  * The command-line option "-relay-only" can be used to specify that all
    media traffic should go through a TURN server.
  * It is now possible to generate TURN passwords automatically, which
    avoids leaking long-term TURN credentials.  See the "credentialType"
    value "hmac-sha1" described in README.
  * The ICE configuration will now be checked periodically, and new
    clients will use an updated configuration.
  * The client-server protocol has been reworked to be more symmetric
    and more secure.  It is now documented in the file README.PROTOCOL.
  * The stream abort protocol message is now supported in the client->server
    direction, making it possible for the client to reject a stream.
  * The delay before sending NACKs has been reduced, which gives a major
    boost in video quality.
  * The play from disk button is not available when the browser doesn't
    support the required API.  We used to display a cryptic error message
    in that case.
  * The command-line option -insecure allows using plain HTTP, which is
    useful when running behind a reverse proxy.
  * When saving to disk to disk, the keyframe interval has been reduced to 4s.
  * We now send keepalives after 55s at most, which should fix issues with
    reverse proxies timing out the WebSocket.

19 December 2020: Galène 0.1

  * Initial release.
